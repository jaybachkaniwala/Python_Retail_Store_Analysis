## Introduction üí°
This project analyzes sales data from an online retailer to uncover key insights including customer purchasing behavior, sales trends, and the impact of discounts. Through the use of Python, in particular data visualization and statistical analysis, we aim to identify patterns that can drive business decisions.

## Key Questions for Analysis ‚ùì
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Sales Trend Over Time** ‚Äì How do sales fluctuate over the year? Are there seasonal trends or spikes in revenue?

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Sales by Product Category** ‚Äì Which product categories generate the highest revenue? Are there categories with consistently low sales performance?

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Impact of Discounts on Sales and product categories** 
    
Sales Volume ‚Äì Do higher discounts lead to increased sales volume, or is there a threshold where discounts lose effectiveness?
Across Product Categories ‚Äì Do discounts have varying impacts on different product categories? Are some categories more discount-sensitive than others?

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Sales by Location** ‚Äì Which regions generate the highest total sales? Are there geographical areas with untapped potential?

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Sales by Age Group**  ‚Äì How do different age groups contribute to total sales? Are younger or older demographics more likely to make purchases?

## Tools Used üî®
This project leverages the following tools and libraries for data analysis and visualization:

**Python**: Primary programming language for data manipulation and analysis

**Pandas**: Used for data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation

**Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Used for visualizing trends, distributions, and comparisons

**Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for exploratory data analysis

**VS Code**: Used as the primary code editor for writing and debugging Python scripts


## Data üìÅ
The dataset used for this analysis contains 1,000,000 rows of online retail sales data. The dataset can be found on Kaggle.

üìÅ [The CSV Data file can be found here] (https://github.com/jaybachkaniwala/Python_Retail_Store_Analysis/blob/main/Online%20Retail%20Sales%20Dataset.csv)

## Analysis & Visualizations üíª

### Import Libraries
```python  
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from datetime import datetime
```

### Load the dataset
```python 
file_path="C:\\Python_Retail_Store_Analysis\\Online Retail Sales Dataset.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
```
### Data Loading and Cleaning
```python 
# Inspect the dataset ; check first few rows
print(df.head())
# Check the column data types
print(df.info())

# Summary statistics
print(df.describe())

# Check for missing values
print(df.isnull().sum())

# Convert 'timestamp' column to datetime format
df['timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(df['timestamp'])
```

### Feature Engineering

```python
# Create Time-based features

df['year'] = df['timestamp'].dt.year
df['month'] = df['timestamp'].dt.month
df['day'] = df['timestamp'].dt.day
df['weekday'] = df['timestamp'].dt.weekday
df['hour'] = df['timestamp'].dt.hour

# Remove duplicates if any
df = df.drop_duplicates()

# Validate Sales Calculation (Total Amount)

# Ensure 'total_amount' is correctly calculated as quantity * price * (1 - discount)
df['calculated_total'] = df['quantity'] * df['price'] * (1 - df['discount'])
```
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**1. Monthly Sales Trend**
```python 
import matplotlib.ticker as mtick  # Import ticker for formatting

# Aggregate sales over time
sales_trend = df.groupby('month')['total_amount'].sum()

# Filter to show only January (1) to November (11)
sales_trend = sales_trend.loc[1:11]

# Plot sales over time
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.lineplot(x=sales_trend.index, y=sales_trend.values, marker='o')

# Formatting the plot
plt.title('Total Sales by Month')
plt.xlabel('Month')
plt.ylabel('Total Sales ($)')  # Adding dollar sign
plt.xticks(ticks=range(1, 12), labels=['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun', 
                                       'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov'])  # Custom month labels

# Format y-axis to show values in full with dollar sign
plt.gca().yaxis.set_major_formatter(mtick.FuncFormatter(lambda x, _: f'${x:,.0f}'))

plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

**Key Insights** üîç

- Overall Sales Stability üìä
The sales figures remain relatively stable across most months, fluctuating between $78M and $85M.
This suggests a consistent revenue stream with no extreme seasonal spikes (except for the decline in November).

- Sales Drop in February üìâ
February shows a noticeable dip in total sales, dropping below $78M.
This could be due to factors such as:
Shorter month (fewer days for transactions).
Post-holiday consumer spending slowdown.
Seasonal trends in the business cycle.

- Strong Recovery in March & May üèÜ
March and May show spikes in sales, suggesting possible promotional campaigns, product launches, or seasonal trends driving higher revenue.

- July & August Peak Performance üî•
The highest revenue months seem to be July and August, possibly indicating:
Increased summer shopping trends.
Back-to-school promotions driving higher sales.

- November Decline üö®
November sees a sharp decline in sales, significantly lower than the previous months.
This is unexpected, as November typically includes Black Friday and Cyber Monday, which should drive sales up, not down.
Possible reasons for this drop:
Data issue - missing transactions for later November days (26-30).
Shift in consumer spending habits (delayed purchases for December?).
Supply chain or stock availability issues affecting order fulfillment.

- Further info required üîç
    Compare with Previous Years (if available): Look at year-over-year trends to understand if this pattern is normal.

**2. Sales by product category**
```python
category_sales = df.groupby('product_category')['total_amount'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False)

import matplotlib.ticker as mtick  # Import ticker for formatting

# Aggregate sales by product category
category_sales = df.groupby('product_category')['total_amount'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False)

# Define y-axis limits to maximize space usage
y_min = category_sales.min() * 0.98  # Slightly below lowest sales value
y_max = category_sales.max() * 1.02  # Slightly above highest sales value

# Create figure
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
ax = sns.barplot(x=category_sales.index, y=category_sales.values, palette="Blues_r")

# Add labels on top of each bar
for index, value in enumerate(category_sales.values):
    ax.text(index, value + (y_max - y_min) * 0.01, f'${value:,.0f}', ha='center', fontsize=10, fontweight='bold')

# Formatting the plot
ax.set_title('Sales by Product Category', fontsize=14, fontweight='bold')
ax.set_xlabel('Product Category', fontsize=12)
ax.set_ylabel('Total Sales ($)', fontsize=12)

# Rotate x-axis labels for better readability
ax.set_xticklabels(ax.get_xticklabels(), rotation=45, ha='right')

# Set optimized y-axis limits
ax.set_ylim(y_min, y_max)

# Format y-axis to show actual dollar values with commas
ax.yaxis.set_major_formatter(mtick.FuncFormatter(lambda x, _: f'${x:,.0f}'))

plt.show()
```

**Key Insights** üîç

üîù **Small Sales Variance Between Categories**

The sales values across product categories are very close to each other, ranging between $157M and $158.4M.
The difference between the highest and lowest-selling category is only about $1.2M, indicating consistent sales performance across categories.

üèÜ **Top-Performing Category: Beauty & Personal Care**

Beauty & Personal Care leads with $158.38m in total sales.
This suggests strong demand for personal care products, possibly driven by consumer loyalty, recurring purchases, or premium pricing.

üìâ **Lowest Sales Category: Home & Kitchen**

Home & Kitchen has the lowest sales at $157.16m, but the difference from other categories is minimal.
This could indicate stable but slightly lower demand, potentially due to seasonality or fewer high-value purchases compared to other categories.

üìä **Sales Distribution is Even**

The small gap between categories suggests a well-balanced product portfolio, where no single category significantly underperforms.
This could mean diversified revenue streams, reducing the risk of reliance on one category.

üöÄ **Potential Areas for Growth**

Since all categories are performing similarly, opportunities for growth may lie in targeted marketing strategies, bundling products, or offering category-specific promotions.
Home & Kitchen could benefit from seasonal campaigns or enhanced product offerings to boost sales.

üéØ **Recommendations for Business Strategy**

‚úî Expand High-Performing Categories ‚Äì Invest in marketing for Beauty & Personal Care to leverage its strong position.

‚úî Analyze Consumer Behavior ‚Äì Understand why the gap is small‚Äîis it pricing, promotions, or customer demand?

‚úî Differentiate Categories ‚Äì Since sales are evenly spread, innovation or unique selling propositions (USPs) can help certain categories stand out and grow.

**3.1 Impact of Discounts on Sales**
```python
import scipy.stats as stats

# Compute Pearson Correlation
correlation, p_value = stats.pearsonr(df["discount"], df["quantity"])

print(f"Pearson Correlation: {correlation:.4f}")
print(f"P-value: {p_value:.4f}")

# Interpretation of Results

Pearson Correlation: -0.0009
This is very close to 0, meaning no significant correlation between discount percentage and sales volume.

In simpler terms, increasing or decreasing discounts does not strongly affect the number of units sold.

P-value: 0.3740
A p-value above 0.05 suggests that the relationship is statistically insignificant.
        
This means the observed correlation could be due to random chance rather than an actual trend.
```

**3.2 Analyze Sales Volume by Discount Brackets**
```python
# Define discount bins (0-1%, 1-2%, ..., 9-10%)
bins = list(range(0, 11))  # Creates bins for 0-1%, 1-2%, ..., 9-10%
labels = [f"{i}-{i+1}%" for i in range(0, 10)]  # Labels for each bin

# Assign discount ranges to the dataset
df["discount_range"] = pd.cut(df["discount"], bins=bins, labels=labels, right=False)

# Compute average sales volume per discount range
discount_analysis = df.groupby("discount_range")["quantity"].mean()

# Plot results
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
sns.barplot(x=discount_analysis.index, y=discount_analysis.values, palette="Blues_r")

# Titles and Labels
plt.title("Average Sales Volume by Discount Range (0-10%)")
plt.xlabel("Discount Range (%)")
plt.ylabel("Average Sales Volume")

plt.show()
```
![Sales Volume by Discount Range](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e819154-dfde-4fc9-bce9-d1ca55318467)


Regarding 3.2 above - no meaningful analysis can be conducted as the discount ranges are limited to the 0-1%, which is too insignificant to draw any conclusions from.

**3.3 Compare Discount Effect Across Product Categories**
```python
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.boxplot(x="discount_range", y="quantity", hue="product_category", data=df)
plt.title("Impact of Discounts on Sales Volume by Product Category")
plt.xlabel("Discount Range (%)")
plt.ylabel("Sales Volume")
plt.legend(loc="upper left", bbox_to_anchor=(1, 1))
plt.show()
```
![Impact of Discounts on Sales Volume by Product Category](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52e8599a-eab0-439e-bfbd-1c588985e966)


Regarding 3.3 above - Because Sales Volume across categories are so similar and also given that there is only 1 discount range (0-1%) that has any data, nothing meaningful can be extracted. What we can say is that Discounts do not seem to have any material impact on sales volume across product categories.

**4. Sales by Location**
```python
location_sales = df.groupby('customer_location')['total_amount'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False)

colors = sns.color_palette("Blues_r", n_colors=len(location_sales))  # Using "Blues_r" for reverse order

# Plot
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
ax = sns.barplot(x=location_sales.index, y=location_sales.values, palette=colors)

# Format y-axis as dollar values
ax.set_ylabel('Total Sales ($)', fontsize=12)
ax.get_yaxis().set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda x, loc: '${:,.2f}'.format(x)))

# Add labels on top of each bar
for p in ax.patches:
    ax.annotate('${:,.2f}'.format(p.get_height()), 
                (p.get_x() + p.get_width() / 2., p.get_height()), 
                ha='center', va='center', 
                fontsize=10, color='black', 
                xytext=(0, 5), textcoords='offset points')

plt.xticks(rotation=90)
plt.title('Sales by Location')
plt.xlabel('Customer Location')
plt.ylabel('Total Sales')
plt.show()
```
![Sales by Location](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8edfe471-ad0e-48cb-ab18-d699d64f2693)

**Key Insights** üîç 

üìä The bar chart generated from the given code shows total sales by customer location, helping to identify geographic trends in sales performance.

**Sales Distribution Across Locations**:

The bar chart illustrates total sales across different customer locations.

üìà South America leads in total sales, closely followed by Australia and Africa.

üìâ North America has the lowest total sales, though the difference between locations is relatively small.


**Minimal Variation Among Locations**:

üìä The total sales figures across all regions are quite close to each other (around $157M‚Äì$158M).

‚öñÔ∏è This suggests a balanced distribution of sales across different geographies, with no single location dominating significantly.

**üí° Potential Business Implications**:

üåç Since no single region vastly outperforms the others, the company may have a well-diversified customer base across global markets.

üöÄ If the goal is expansion, the company may consider targeting North America, as it has the lowest sales.

üéØ Market-specific strategies might be required to boost sales in underperforming regions.

**5. Sales by Age Group**
```python
# Define age brackets
age_bins = [18, 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, 100]
age_labels = ['18-25', '26-35', '36-45', '46-55', '56-65', '66+']

# Assign age bracket labels to the 'customer_age' column
df['age_group'] = pd.cut(df['customer_age'], bins=age_bins, labels=age_labels, right=False)

# Group by age bracket and sum the total sales
age_sales = df.groupby('age_group')['total_amount'].sum()

blues = sns.color_palette("Blues", len(age_sales))

# Plot
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
ax = sns.barplot(x=age_sales.index, y=age_sales.values, palette=blues)

# Add labels on top of the bars
for p in ax.patches:
    ax.annotate(f'${p.get_height():,.2f}', 
                (p.get_x() + p.get_width() / 2., p.get_height()), 
                ha='center', va='center', 
                fontsize=10, color='black', 
                xytext=(0, 5), textcoords='offset points')

# Title and labels
plt.title('Total Sales by Age Group')
plt.xlabel('Age Group')
plt.ylabel('Total Sales ($)')
plt.show()
```
![Sales by Age](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ca81b74-88e9-44ea-9fab-d776e2a212a4)

**Key Insights üîç**

**üéØ Sales Distribution Across Age Groups**:

üìä The 26-35, 36-45, and 46-55 age groups have the highest total sales, all around $182M.

üìà The 56-65 age group follows closely with around $181M in total sales.

‚ö†Ô∏è The 18-25 and 66+ age groups have significantly lower total sales, at $127M and $90M, respectively.

**üîç Key Observations & Trends**:

üìå Peak Spending Age Groups: The 26-65 age range dominates sales, indicating that middle-aged customers are the primary revenue drivers.

üìâ Lower Sales for Young & Senior Groups:

18-25 (Young Adults): Lower spending, possibly due to limited disposable income or different purchasing behaviors.
66+ (Seniors): A sharp decline in sales, potentially due to reduced need for certain products/services or lower engagement with the platform.


**üí° Business Implications**:

üéØ Targeted Marketing: Since 26-55 is the most profitable age range, this businesses could look at prioritizing marketing efforts toward these segments.

üöÄ Youth Engagement Opportunity:
The 18-25 group shows a gap in sales, suggesting an opportunity to introduce:

üéì Student discounts

üí≥ Loyalty programs

üõçÔ∏è Youth-oriented products


üèÜ Senior Market Potential: The 66+ group has the lowest sales, but could be an untapped market. Strategies to increase engagement include:

üëµ Senior-friendly services

üéüÔ∏è Exclusive discounts

üè† Customized promotions

## Business Strategy & Recommendations üîÜ

‚úÖ **Optimize Promotional Efforts:**  
   - Instead of increasing discounts, invest in personalized marketing & loyalty programs.  

‚úÖ **Enhance Product Positioning:**  
   - Boost sales in Home & Kitchen with seasonal campaigns or product bundling.  

‚úÖ **Address November Sales Decline:**  
   - Conduct further analysis to determine if this is a data issue or a trend shift.  

‚úÖ **Expand in Underperforming Regions:**  
   - Localized marketing efforts can increase North American sales.  

‚úÖ **Refine Target Audience Engagement:**  
   - Leverage insights to tailor marketing for high-spending age groups while experimenting with engagement strategies for younger & older customers.  

üì¢ _By implementing these recommendations, the company can enhance revenue, optimize marketing spend, and improve customer engagement._ üöÄ  


# Further Information required for enhanced analysis ‚ùó
As an analyst, additional data/information would enhance the depth of this analysis, including:

üìå**Data on costs**: so that profitability can be calculated - which would be a great financial metric to track, as we can then determine how this company is performing. 

üìå **Previous year data**: Data on previous years data would be useful for comparative purposes to ascertain whether business performance is improving or declining.

üìå **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**: Understanding repeat purchases and total revenue per customer.

üìå **Marketing Campaign Data**: Identifying whether sales spikes align with promotions, ads, or seasonal campaigns.

üìå **Discounts offered**: I would also questions to business leaders regarding why greater discounts are not offered.

üìå **Competitor Pricing Data**: Comparing discount effectiveness against industry benchmarks.

üìå **Product Return Rates**: Assessing whether certain discounts lead to higher return rates.

üìå **Website Traffic Data**: Correlating sales trends with online customer visits and browsing behavior.


## What I learnt:

‚úÖ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying key trends, patterns, and relationships in sales data.

‚úÖ **Data Visualization**: Creating meaningful visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to communicate findings effectively.

‚úÖ **Statistical Analysis**: Understanding correlations, distribution trends, and the impact of discounts on sales.
